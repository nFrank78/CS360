## App Requirements and Goals
The goal of this app was to create an inventory management app that provided the user with an easy-to-use interface and overall smooth inventory management experience. The requirements were that the application must require the user to create an account and login to access their inventory. The inventory itself must allow for the adding, deleting, and editing of inventory items. Each item must have an editable quantity and if the user allows notifications then they must be given a notification when an item is running low.

The app is intended for users who want an easy to use, secure inventory management system which has a database that is stored locally to their device instead of online. This could be for company use or private use for collectors or just general organization. Regardless of the user's intended use for this application, I attempted to create a smooth interface that was intuitive with great functionality.

## Application Screens and UI
   I designed the application to first open up the login screen so the user must login or create and account before they can view their inventory. Once the user successfully logs in, they are directly brought to the inventory screen that is populated with their added inventory items or an empty list if they have not added any items. From their, the user can easily add an item by pressing the add item FAB that is in the bottom right of the screen. At the top right of the screen is an options button that, when pressed, brings the user to the settings menu (Currently there is only a settings option for toggling notifications on or off).

   The next screen the user may find themselves on is the edit item screen which appears when the user either presses the add item FAB or the edit item button on the item within the inventory list. This edit item screen allows the user to edit the name of the item and the quantity and comes with a save button at the bottom to save changes or a delete button to delete the item. If the delete button is pressed then the user is asked if they are sure and if the user presses yes again then the item is deleted and the user is directed back to the inventory screen. The user is also directed back to the inventory screen when they press the save button.
   
   I think the design of the UI of this app was successful because this is a utility app that revolves around managing an inventory. The inventory is the main screen and the user must login to access their secured inventory. The inventory items are directly editable from the inventory screen if they have already been added to the inventory and when they add an item via the FAB, the user is directed to the new item's page where they can edit the item. This overall design and the centering around the inventory screen makes for a smooth interface that is intuitive and focused around the true intent of the app.
