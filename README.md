## App Requirements and Goals
The goal of this app was to create an inventory management app that provided the user with an easy-to-use interface and overall smooth inventory management experience. The requirements were that the application must require the user to create an account and login to access their inventory. The inventory itself must allow for the adding, deleting, and editing of inventory items. Each item must have an editable quantity and if the user allows notifications then they must be given a notification when an item is running low.
